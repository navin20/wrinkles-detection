# we are currently researching the ways to use basic image processing deep learning method or tensorflow api to help in detecting wrinkles.




## There are 3 ways we will compare then after we finish the best one will be used for the detection in the health care


### 1. haarcascade






### 2. cnn with detection box and image tensor and labelling tools
#### a. classification part without detection boxes:

##                               I .    D       .     L        LAB PROJECT            LMAO



# Our aim of this project is to basically help the health care to detect wrinkles of old people with the help of computer vision.

# we are currently researching the ways to use basic image processing deep learning method or tensorflow api to help in detecting wrinkles.




## There are 3 ways we will compare then after we finish the best one will be used for the detection in the health care


### 1. haarcascade






### 2. cnn with detection box and image tensor and labelling tools








### 3.tensorflow object detection api without using transfer learning

##                     my First           I .    D   .     L        PROJECT



# The aim of this project is to basically help the health care to detect wrinkles of old people with the help of computer vision.

# I am currently researching the ways to use basic image processing deep learning method or tensorflow api to help in detecting wrinkles.




## There are 3 ways we will compare then after we finish the best one will be used for the detection in the health care


### 1. haarcascade






### 2. cnn with detection box and image tensor and labelling tools
#### a. classification part without detection boxes:

### 3.tensorflow object detection api without using transfer learning

# For  the wrinkle classificiation coding refer to my another repository -> https://github.com/navin20/Image-Classification-Using-Keras


# just modify the code according to the folder name like wrinkles or non wrinkles and train it and test
